### The first documented overflow attack

The Computer Security Technology Planning study compiled a paper to present computer security requirements for the US air force.

While discussing a program that handled pointers, it reads:

> “By supplying addresses outside the space allocated to the users programs, it is often possible to get the monitor to obtain unauthorized data for that user, or at the very least, generate a set of conditions in the monitor that causes a system crash.”

It goes on to describe another operating system where

> “the code performing this function does not check the source and destination addresses properly, permitting portions of the monitor to be overlaid by the user. This can be used to inject code into the monitor that will permit the user to seize control of the machine.”

### The Morris Worm

Robert Tappan Morris \(Jr.\) wrote and released the "Morris Worm" whilst being a student at Cornell University. This was the first computer worm to be distributed via the internet, which one of its attack vectors was a smash the stack against the fingerd daemon. In Eugene Spafford's analysis of the worm

> “The bug exploited to break fingerd involved overrunning the buffer the daemon used for input. The standard C library has a few routines that read input without checking for bounds on the buffer involved. In particular, the gets call takes input to a buffer without doing any bounds checking; this was the call exploited by the Worm.”

### An empirical study of the reliability of UNIX utilities

Barton Miller published "An empirical study of the reliability of the UNIX utilities in the ACM". With relatively simple \(compared to today's\) fuzzing, they were "able to crash 25-33% of the utility programs on any version of UNIX that was tested"
