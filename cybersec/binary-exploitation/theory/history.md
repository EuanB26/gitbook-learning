#### The first documented overflow attack

The Computer Security Technology Planning study compiled a paper to present computer security requirements for the US air force.

While discussing a program that handled pointers, it reads: 

[http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/projects/history/papers/ande72a.pdf](http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/projects/history/papers/ande72a.pdf)

> “By supplying addresses outside the space allocated to the users programs, it is often possible to get the monitor to obtain unauthorized data for that user, or at the very least, generate a set of conditions in the monitor that causes a system crash.”

It goes on to describe another operating system where

> “the code performing this function does not check the source and destination addresses properly, permitting portions of the monitor to be overlaid by the user. This can be used to inject code into the monitor that will permit the user to seize control of the machine.”

#### The Morris Worm

Robert Tappan Morris \(Jr.\) wrote and released the "Morris Worm" whilst being a student at Cornell University. This was the first computer worm to be distributed via the internet, which one of its attack vectors was a smash the stack against the fingerd daemon. In Eugene Spafford's analysis of the worm

> “The bug exploited to break fingerd involved overrunning the buffer the daemon used for input. The standard C library has a few routines that read input without checking for bounds on the buffer involved. In particular, the **gets** call takes input to a buffer without doing any bounds checking; this was the call exploited by the Worm.”

The fingerd program has a 512 byte buffer for `gets()`. The Morris Worm crafted an exploit of 536 bytes, which overwrote the return frame of the stack, now pointing to shellcode that would execute `execve("/bin/sh",0,0)`

### 03/12

#### Splitvt exploit published

DaveG and VicM of Avalon Research published an advisory \(and exploit\) for splitvt on Linux 2-3.x. This was due to an unbounded `sprintf` call, which was exploited by and over long HOME environment variable.

## 1996

### 08/11

#### Smashing the stack published

Elias Levy \(Aleph1\) published what would become the mot referenced paper on memory corruption attacks in Phrack49.

> `smash the stack` \[C programming\] n. On many C implementations it is possible to corrupt the execution stack by writing past the end of an array declared auto in a routine. Code that does this is said to smash the stack, and can cause return from the routine to jump to a random address. This can produce some of the most insidious data-dependent bugs known to mankind.

## 1997

### 20/01

#### Stack smashing defenses discussed

Bugtraq hosts a discussion on defenses against stack smashing

### 21/03

#### Superprobe exploit published

Solar designers overwrite function pointers to hijack execution flow

### 22/04

#### DNS poisoning QID prediction

CORE and SNI report possible overflow due to bind ignoring

{% embed url="https://bak.spc.org/dms/archive/dns\_id\_attack.txt" %}

### 12/04

#### NX stack

Alexander Pesylak \(Solar Designer\) posted on Bugtraq a linux patch to defeat the smashing the stack attacks. This included changing the memory permissions of the stack to read and write instead of read, write and execute \(what we know today as NX\)

{% embed url="https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=94346976029249&w=2" %}

### 10/08

#### Bypassing non-execute stack \(ret2libc\)

Alexander Pesylak published his first known return-to-libc attack to overcome his own non-executable stack patch.

He demonstrated the technique using the `lpr` exploit against a Linux system with his own non-executable stack patch. His patch ensured that shared libraries are `mmap`ed into regions containing a null byte to reduce their use with unsafe string functions

{% embed url="https://insecure.org/sploits/linux.libc.return.lpr.sploit.html" %}

He also improved his previous non-executable stack patch with a technique called ASCII Armoring. This makes BOFs more difficult because it'll map the shared libraries on memory addresses that contain a null byte, such as `0xb7e39d00`. If `strcpy()` was used, it terminates at a null byte, therefore not all of the address being got from the function.

### 01/09

#### Nmap - art of portscanning

NMap is released in Phrack 51

### 18/12

#### StackGuard announcement + canary

Crispin Cowan announced StackGuard on Bugtraq with a link to his pre-released USENIX paper titled "StackGuard: automatic adaptive detection and prevention of buffer-overflow attacks"

[https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/full\_papers/cowan/cowan.pdf](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/full_papers/cowan/cowan.pdf)

Their invention was a GCC patch that makes use of a "canary" DWORD on the stack in front of the return address to determine whether the return address has been modified

### 19/12

#### StackGuard bypasses discussed

Tim Newsham posts to Bugtraq with possible weaknesses with StackGuard. He covers attacking local variables and possible leaks of the canary value

## 1998

### 14/01

#### IE4 Heap overflow

Christien Rloux \(DilDog\) published his exploit and advisory for the mk:// exploit on Internet Explorer 4. The bug was a heap based overflow with the exploit code written for Windows 95

{% embed url="https://www.digiater.nl/openvms/decus/vmslt98a/nt/ie4-4.htm" %}

### 30/01

Rafal Wojtczuk \(Nergal\) wrote to Bugtraq another way to perform return-to-libc attacks in order to defeat the non-executable stack. This wasn't confined to `system("/bin/sh")` and used other functions such as `strcpy()` and chain them together.

{% embed url="https://insecure.org/sploits/non-executable.stack.problems.html" %}

### 16/04

#### The Tao of Windows Buffer Overflow

DilDog published his documents of how to write Windows based Buffer Overflows. "The Tao" becomes a template that Win32 tutorials are based on for the the next couple years

{% embed url="https://seclists.org/bugtraq/1998/Apr/100" %}

## 1999

### 31/01

#### w00w00 on heap overflows

Matt Conover and w00w00 published "w00w00 on Heap Overflows". The paper credited the previous work done on heap based overflows and documented possible exploitation using sample programs.

> "Some people have actually suggested making a "local" buffer a "static" buffer, as a fix! This not very wise; yet, it is a fairly common misconception of how the heap or bss work."

### 01/05

#### MITRE forms CVE Initiative

### 09/09

#### Dark Spyrit Win32 Buffer Overflow

Barnaby Jack \(Dark Spyrit\) published "Win32 Buffer Overflows \(Location, Exploitation and Prevention\)" in Phrack 55. Using a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Seattle Labs Mail Server, he demonstrated how to locate the bug using tracing and debugging, and then walked through the shellcode challenges posed by Win32 system \(covering the use of trampoline calls\)

{% embed url="http://phrack.org/issues/55/15.html" %}

#### "The frame pointer overwrite"

Klog published "The Frame Pointer Overwrite" in phrack 55. He showed how to gain execution by using a single byte overflow to overwrite the last byte of `%esp` . In some situations, this can result in the calling function retrieving its saved `%eip` from an attacker defined location resulting in altered execution flow.

### 20/09

#### Format string bug in proftpd 1.2.0pre6

In the first public disclosure of format string bugs, Tymm Twillman posted an email to bugtraq after having notified the proftpd maintainers discussing remote hole in proftpd. This was due to the function `snprintf()`

### 21/10

#### Advanced buffer overflow exploits

Taeh Oh publishes "Advanced Buffer Overflow Exploit" describing techniques to bypass filtering restrictions, bypassing `seteuid(getuid())` and breaking out of chroots
