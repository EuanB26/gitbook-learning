# \(SIG\)ROP

Let's first talk about what ROP is

## ROP

Return Orientated Programming \(ROP\) is essentially chaining together parts of the program, in assembly, to allow us to gain a shell from the binary, or do other malicious things.

The reason that we use ROP is because most binaries, when out in the wild or even in CTFs, don't have a "win" function. Therefore, we have to create our own.

When we've managed to pwn the binary and are wondering where to go next, we need to call `execve` \(or it's family, that is `execl`,`execle`, `execlp`,`execlpe`,`execv`, `execve`, `execvp`, more can be at [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exec-family-of-functions-in-c/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exec-family-of-functions-in-c/)\) or `system`. But we're going to need some arguments ... one common one is the string `/bin/sh` as that's what our terminals run off of - using the programing language `bash` which is spawn in via `/bin/sh`.

Sow how would we provide our arguments to the function? Well the function will expect it to be called via this:

* &lt;function&gt;
* &lt;exit function / junk&gt;
* &lt;argument&gt;
