# Stack Pivotting

Let's first talk about stack frames:

We have a code snippet:

```java
void scanInput(int iParm1)

{
  undefined input [256];
 
  input[0] = 0;
  print("Ok, what do you have to say for yourself?");
  fgets(0,input,(long)iParm1);
  printf("Interesting thought \"%s\", I\'ll take it into consideration.\n",input);
  return;
}
```

Where it simply scans in our input and stores it into a variable. Our `stack frame` would look something like this

```java
+------------+
| stack data |
|    input   |
+------------+
|  base ptr  |
| instr ptr  |
+------------+
```

### What is a stack frame?

Where we have

* `stack data` being the variables that are kept on the stack \(so our `input`\)
* After, you have a `base ptr` for the stack and a
